This is an attempt at consolidating the particle-tracking code that I used
to simulate scallop larval dispersal in my M.Sc thesis at Dalhousie University.

The MATLAB classes and helper functions located here provide a simple syntax
for generating and analyzing the results that were published in that thesis
(http://myweb.dal.ca/ch273514/gilbert_thesis.pdf).

The code isn't fully organized, but it's now hosted here in the interest of 
scientific openness.
